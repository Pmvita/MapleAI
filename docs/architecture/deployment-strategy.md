# Deployment Strategy

## Overview

MapleAI's deployment strategy is designed for enterprise-grade reliability, scalability, and security. Our multi-environment approach ensures smooth development-to-production workflows while maintaining the highest standards of operational excellence.

## Deployment Architecture

### Multi-Environment Strategy
```
Development → Staging → Production
     ↓           ↓          ↓
   Local      Pre-prod    Live
   Testing    Testing     Users
```

### Infrastructure Components
- **Load Balancers**: Global load balancing with health checks
- **Application Servers**: Auto-scaling containerized applications
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL with read replicas
- **Caching**: Redis cluster for session and data caching
- **CDN**: Global content delivery network
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability stack

## Environment Configuration

```

## Containerization Strategy

### Docker Configuration
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for optimization
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine AS runtime
WORKDIR /app

# Security: Run as non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001

COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --chown=nextjs:nodejs . .

USER nextjs

EXPOSE 3000
ENV NODE_ENV=production

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

  development: {
    autoApply: true,
    resetAllowed: true,
    seedData: true
  },
  staging: {
    autoApply: false,
    manualReview: true,

    rollbackPlan: true
  },
  production: {
    autoApply: false,
    maintenanceWindow: true,
    blueGreenDeployment: true,
    rollbackPlan: true,
    monitoring: true
  }
};
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Deploy MapleAI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
    
    - name: Run security scan
      run: npm run security:scan
    
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build

  deploy-staging:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    environment: staging
    
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to staging
      run: |
        # Deploy to staging environment
        kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/
        kubectl rollout status deployment/mapleai-app -n staging

  deploy-production:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    environment: production
    
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: |
        # Blue-green deployment
        kubectl apply -f k8s/production/
        kubectl rollout status deployment/mapleai-app -n production
        
        # Health check
        ./scripts/health-check.sh
        
        # Switch traffic
        kubectl patch service mapleai-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"v2"}}}'
```

### Deployment Strategies

#### Blue-Green Deployment
```yaml
Blue-Green Strategy:
  Blue Environment:
    - Current production version
    - Receiving 100% of traffic
    - Stable and tested
    
  Green Environment:
    - New version deployment
    - No traffic initially
    - Health checks and testing
    
  Switch Process:
    - Deploy to green environment
    - Run comprehensive tests
    - Switch traffic gradually (10%, 50%, 100%)
    - Monitor for issues
    - Rollback if problems detected
```

#### Canary Deployment
```yaml
Canary Strategy:
  Traffic Distribution:
    - 90% to stable version
    - 10% to new version
    
  Monitoring:
    - Error rates
    - Response times
    - Business metrics
    
  Gradual Rollout:
    - 10% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
    - Each step with monitoring period
    - Automatic rollback on issues
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Application Monitoring
```typescript
// Health check endpoints
const healthChecks = {
  '/api/health': {
    checks: [
      'database_connection',
      'redis_connection',
      'external_services'
    ],
    timeout: 5000
  },
  '/api/ready': {
    checks: [
      'application_started',
      'database_migrations',
      'cache_warmup'
    ],
    timeout: 3000
  }
};
```

### Metrics Collection
```yaml
Metrics Stack:
  Application Metrics:
    - Prometheus for metrics collection
    - Grafana for visualization
    - Custom business metrics
    
  Infrastructure Metrics:
    - CPU, memory, disk usage
    - Network I/O
    - Database performance
    
  Business Metrics:
    - User activity
    - Feature usage
    - Error rates
    - Response times
```

### Logging Strategy
```typescript
// Structured logging configuration
const loggingConfig = {
  development: {
    level: 'debug',
    format: 'pretty',
    destination: 'console'
  },
  staging: {
    level: 'info',
    format: 'json',
    destination: 'file'
  },
  production: {
    level: 'warn',
    format: 'json',
    destination: 'centralized',
    retention: '30 days'
  }
};
```

## Security in Deployment

### Secrets Management
```yaml
Secrets Strategy:
  Development:
    - Environment variables in .env files
    - No sensitive data in code
    
  Staging/Production:
    - Kubernetes secrets
    - AWS Secrets Manager
    - Encrypted at rest and in transit
    - Regular rotation
```

### Network Security
```yaml
Network Configuration:
  - VPC with private subnets
  - Security groups with minimal access
  - WAF for DDoS protection
  - SSL/TLS termination at load balancer
  - VPN for secure access
```

## Backup & Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
```yaml
Backup Configuration:
  Database:
    - Automated daily backups
    - Point-in-time recovery (15-minute RPO)
    - Cross-region replication
    - 30-day retention
    
  Application:
    - Configuration backups
    - Code repository backups
    - Infrastructure as Code backups
    
  Testing:
    - Monthly backup restoration tests
    - Disaster recovery drills
    - Documentation updates
```

### Disaster Recovery Plan
```yaml
DR Strategy:
  RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 4 hours
  RPO (Recovery Point Objective): 15 minutes
  
  Recovery Steps:
    1. Assess disaster scope
    2. Activate DR environment
    3. Restore from backups
    4. Verify data integrity
    5. Switch traffic
    6. Monitor stability
    7. Document lessons learned
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
```typescript
// Multi-layer caching
const cachingStrategy = {
  browser: {
    staticAssets: '1 year',
    apiResponses: '5 minutes'
  },
  CDN: {
    staticContent: '1 hour',
    apiResponses: '1 minute'
  },
  application: {
    userSessions: '24 hours',
    databaseQueries: '5 minutes',
    aiModelResponses: '1 hour'
  }
};
```

### Auto-scaling Configuration
```yaml
Auto-scaling Rules:
  CPU-based:
    - Scale up: CPU > 70% for 5 minutes
    - Scale down: CPU < 30% for 10 minutes
    
  Memory-based:
    - Scale up: Memory > 80% for 5 minutes
    - Scale down: Memory < 50% for 10 minutes
    
  Custom metrics:
    - Request queue length
    - Response time
    - Error rate
```

## Environment-Specific Configurations

### Development
```bash
# Development deployment
npm run dev
# Hot reload, debug mode, local database
```

### Staging
```bash
# Staging deployment
docker build -t mapleai:staging .
docker push registry.mapleai.com/mapleai:staging
kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/
```

### Production
```bash
# Production deployment
docker build -t mapleai:production .
docker push registry.mapleai.com/mapleai:production
kubectl apply -f k8s/production/
kubectl rollout status deployment/mapleai-app
```
